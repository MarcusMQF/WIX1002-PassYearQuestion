# Participant Pairing and Seating Arrangement Program

This program reads participant information from a file, pairs participants based on their addresses, and writes the seating arrangement to a new file.

## Flow of the Program

### 1. Read the Input File
- The program reads `participant.txt` using a `Scanner` to count the number of lines (participants).
- It then rewinds the `Scanner` to read the file again and populate a 2D array (`participants`) with the participant data.

### 2. Normalize the Addresses
- The program normalizes the addresses by removing all spaces and punctuation and converting them to lowercase. This helps to compare addresses in a consistent way.

### 3. Pair Participants
- The program compares the normalized addresses of participants to find pairs.
- If two participants have the same address, they are paired together and stored in a `pairs` array.

### 4. Check for Missing Pairs
- After attempting to form pairs, the program checks if all participants were successfully paired. If not, a warning message is displayed.

### 5. Write the Output File
- The program writes the seating arrangement to a file called `grouping.txt`, assigning participants to "Seat A", "Seat B", "Seat C", and "Seat D" based on the pairs formed.
- The output format includes the participant's name and age.

## Input File Format
Each line in the `participant.txt` file should contain four values separated by commas: name, gender, age, and address. 

The conversion of the addresses in the provided program is done by normalizing them to a standard format. This step ensures that comparisons between addresses are consistent, even if the addresses are written differently (e.g., with varying spaces, punctuation, or case). Below is a detailed explanation of the normalization process:


## Conversion logic

### 1. **Trimming White Spaces**:
   ```java
   address = address.trim();
   ```
   The `trim()` method removes any leading or trailing spaces from the address string. This is useful because addresses may have extra spaces at the beginning or end that should not affect the comparison.

### 2. **Converting to Lowercase**:
   ```java
   address = address.toLowerCase();
   ```
   This step converts all the characters in the address string to lowercase. The reason for this is to ensure case-insensitivity during comparison. For example, "No.67 Jalan BP10/12 Kelang" and "no.67 jalan bp10/12 kelang" should be considered equivalent, despite the differences in capitalization.

### 3. **Removing Extra Spaces**:
   ```java
   address = address.replaceAll("\\s+", "");
   ```
   The `replaceAll()` method with the regular expression `\\s+` replaces all whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.) with no characters, effectively removing them. This ensures that any spaces within the address (whether between words or part of the street name) don't affect the comparison. For example, "No. 67 Jalan BP10/12 Kelang" and "No.67JalanBP10/12Kelang" will both become "no.67jalanbp10/12kelang".

### 4. **Removing Punctuation**:
   ```java
   address = address.replaceAll("[^a-z0-9]", "");
   ```
   This step removes all characters that are not lowercase alphabetic (`a-z`) or numeric (`0-9`). The regular expression `[^a-z0-9]` matches any character that is not in the range of `a-z` or `0-9`, and `replaceAll()` removes these characters from the string. For example:
   - "No.67 Jalan BP10/12 Kelang" becomes "no67jalanbp1012kelang"
   - The period (`.`), slash (`/`), and other punctuation marks are discarded.

### 5. **Final Normalized Address**:
   After performing these transformations, the address is converted into a string that is easier to compare. This normalized string has no spaces, punctuation, or differences in case, ensuring that addresses like:
   - "No. 67 Jalan BP10/12 Kelang"
   - "no.67jalanbp10/12kelang"
   - "no67JalanBP10/12Kelang"
   
   will all become identical after normalization.

### Example:

Let's take an example address and go through the steps:
- **Original Address**: `"No.67 Jalan BP10/12 Kelang"`
  
  After applying the normalization process:
  - **Trim**: `"No.67 Jalan BP10/12 Kelang"` → `"No.67 Jalan BP10/12 Kelang"` (no change)
  - **Lowercase**: `"No.67 Jalan BP10/12 Kelang"` → `"no.67 jalan bp10/12 kelang"`
  - **Remove extra spaces**: `"no.67 jalan bp10/12 kelang"` → `"no.67jalanbp10/12kelang"`
  - **Remove punctuation**: `"no.67jalanbp10/12kelang"` → `"no67jalanbp1012kelang"`

  The final normalized address becomes `"no67jalanbp1012kelang"`.

This normalized format makes it easy to compare addresses even if they are written differently by users.

### Why is this necessary?
By normalizing the addresses, you remove inconsistencies that could arise due to user input or file formatting. This helps ensure accurate comparisons of addresses, making it easier to pair participants even if their address entries vary slightly in formatting.
